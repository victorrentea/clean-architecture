## Title
Use Spark Batching for new jobs

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Due to complexity and lack of knowledge inside the project,
developing and maintaining Spark Streaming applications proves to be a real challange.
Batching can run fast enough to emulate a pseudo streaming
OutOfMemoryError using Rocks DB, embedded state database for Spark Stateful Streaming.

## Decision
- New Spark functionalities be developed using Spark Batch.
- Changes to the existing Spark Streaming applications will require a higher estimation x 3.

## Consequences
### Positives
- Less complexity; developers are more familiar with Spark Batching
- Easier reprocessing of late events
- No Kafka involved ðŸ˜Ž

### Negatives
- Added latency in data processing (~500 seconds)
- Hard to manage state for Spark Batching applications

## Compliance
